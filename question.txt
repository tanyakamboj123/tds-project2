Use the undirected network in edges.csv. Return a JSON object with keys:

edge_count: number

highest_degree_node: string

average_degree: number

density: number

shortest_path_alice_eve: number

network_graph: base64 PNG string under 100kB

degree_histogram: base64 PNG string under 100kB

Answer:

How many edges are in the network?

Which node has the highest degree?

What is the average degree of the network?

What is the network density?

What is the length of the shortest path between Alice and Eve?

Draw the network with nodes labelled and edges shown. Encode as base64 PNG.

Plot the degree distribution as a bar chart with green bars. Encode as base64 PNG.
